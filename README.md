**No More Distractions**

This is a simple python script I wrote to help you to stay focused on your work. It forces you to remain
on a particular web page, although you may still navigate around, you will be unable to use the address bar.

To run the program, you simply run the script, enter the number of minutes you 
would like to focus for, and enter the site you will be working on. First navigate to the 
site you wish to use, and copy and paste the full url from the address bar. If you really need to,
you probably can find a way out, or may shut down your computer, but it helps fight off those impulses you
have while bored.

This works great for things like reading lecture notes, watching tutorials, doing emails and more. Once
you have completed your inputted time, you will be alerted and free for normal use. Currently, this 
design only works for Google Chrome, but I hope to change it up to allow for more flexibility.
